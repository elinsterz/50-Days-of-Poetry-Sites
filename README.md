# 100 Days of Poetry Sites
Summer 2019

For the next 100 days I will be creating microsites using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The content for each site are taken from a poem or short story. The first day will be selecting the text, designing the static page using HTML and CSS. The second day will be adding interactivity using Javascript.
