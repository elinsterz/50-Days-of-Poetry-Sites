    Think how they must look now, the mangrove keys
    lying out there unresponsive to the lightning
    in dark, coarse-fibred families,

    where occasionally a heron may undo his head,
    shake up his feathers, make an uncertain comment
    when the surrounding water shines.

    Think of the boulevard and the little palm trees
    all stuck in rows, suddenly revealed
    as fistfuls of limp fish-skeletons.

    It is raining there. The boulevard
    and its broken sidewalks with weeds in every crack
    are relieved to be wet, the sea to be freshened.

    Now the storm goes away again in a series
    of small, badly lit battle-scenes,
    each in "Another part of the field."

    Think of someone sleeping in the bottom of a row-boat
    tied to a mangrove root or the pile of a bridge;
    think of him as uninjured, barely disturbed.
