                The part of life <br>
                devoted to contemplation<br>
                was at odds with the part<br>
                committed to action.<br>
                <br>
                *<br>
                <br>
                Fall was approaching.<br>
                But I remember<br>
                it was always approaching<br>
                once school ended.<br>
                <br>
                *<br>
                <br>
                Life, my sister said,<br>
                is like a torch passed now<br>
                from the body to the mind.<br>
                Sadly, she went on, the mind is not<br>
                there to receive it.<br>
                <br>
                The sun was setting.<br>
                Ah, the torch, she said.<br>
                It has gone out, I believe.<br>
                Our best hope is that it’s flickering,<br>
                fort/da, fort/da, like little Ernst<br>
                throwing his toy over the side of his crib<br>
                and then pulling it back. It’s too bad,<br>
                she said, there are no children here.<br>
                We could learn from them, as Freud did.<br>
                <br>
                *
                <br>
                We would sometimes sit<br>
                on benches outside the dining room.<br>
                The smell of leaves burning.<br>
                <br>
                Old people and fire, she said.<br>
                Not a good thing. They burn their houses down.<br>
                <br>
                *<br>
                <br>
                How heavy my mind is,<br>
                filled with the past.<br>
                Is there enough room<br>
                for the world to penetrate?<br>
                It must go somewhere,<br>
                it cannot simply sit on the surface—<br>
                <br>
                *<br>
                <br>
                Stars gleaming over the water.<br>
                The leaves piled, waiting to be lit.<br>
                <br>
                *<br>
                <br>
                Insight, my sister said.<br>
                Now it is here.<br>
                But hard to see in the darkness.<br>
                <br>
                You must find your footing
                before you put your weight on it.
