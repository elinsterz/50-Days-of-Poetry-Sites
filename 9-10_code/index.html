<h1>Reincarnation</h1>
<h1>By Ellen Bass</h1>

<p>
    Who would believe in reincarnation
    if she thought she would return as
    an oyster? Eagles and wolves
    are popular. Even domesticated cats
    have their appeal. It’s not terribly distressing
    to imagine being Missy, nibbling
    kibble and lounging on the windowsill.
    But I doubt the toothsome oyster has ever
    been the totem of any shaman
    fanning the Motherpeace Tarot
    or smudging with sage.
    Yet perhaps we could do worse
    than aspire to be a plump bivalve. Humbly,
    the oyster persists in filtering
    seawater and fashioning the daily
    irritations into lustre.
    Dash a dot of Tabasco, pair it
    with a dry Martini, not only
    will this tender button inspire
    an erotic fire in tuxedoed men
    and women whose shoulders gleam
    in candlelight, this hermit praying
    in its rocky cave, this anchorite of iron,
    calcium, and protein, is practically
    a molluskan saint. Revered and sacrificed,
    body and salty liquor of the soul,
    the oyster is devoured, surrendering
    all—again and again—for love.__
