    <p>Love Poem</p>
    <p>By Linda Gregerson</p>
    <p>1.

            Once, my very best darling, the sea
            and the land were all one mass
            
            and the light was confused and hadn’t found
            a place to rest. And, Megan, love,
            
            my sister’s eyes were not yet there to hold it all
            together since she hadn’t yet been born so when
            
            the world dropped out from under us and no one,
            not the on-calls with their CAT scans, not
            
            the sovereign souls who monitor
            the twilit room where newborns come to die
            
            or live, when no one could tell us if you
            would be one of the lucky ones able to
            
            walk and speak and only this, the one
            unstinted blessing fate had given us to
            
            give you was a sister in whose eyes you were
            the sun and moon, it meant we all no matter
            
            what befell us all
            had solid ground.    Pity the part
            
            we think we do on purpose.
            
            2.
            
            When Karen was dying and books had shut
            their doors to her, she could still make out the
            
            puzzle of knit and purl. I’m keeping it simple,
            she said, although the pattern
            
            emerging beneath her fine hands did not
            look simple to me. An
            
            A. A B. An alphabet. And all in the single
            color, milk. The letters distinguished
            
            by only the altered stitchwork so
            the nursery would be beautiful.
            
            Whichever of the children has a baby first,
            she said, she loved
            
            the future, no matter she wouldn’t be there.
            
            3.
            
            Second-born. As fateful as the transit
            to light and air or so you’ve often tried
            
            to teach me I will never properly understand.
            But I know
            
            how the hair at your temples curls in
            summer when the air is moist. As if
            
            she’d been returned to me.
            I must have had some under-the-radar
            
            notion even then when we were children how
            that little looseness threw
            
            my petty masteries in the shade. And so
            the joy of it was lost on me. Till you.
            
            I’m the only person living who
            remembers her childhood curls.
